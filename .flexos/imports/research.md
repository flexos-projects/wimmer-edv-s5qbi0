### **Website Redesign Research: Wimmer EDV**

**Client Domain:** `https://www.wimmer-edv.at`
**Objective:** Consolidate research to inform the strategy and build of a modern, more effective website.

---

### 1. Business Facts

*   **Company Name:** Wimmer EDV
*   **Core Business:** IT services provider for small and medium-sized businesses (KMU - Kleine und mittlere Unternehmen). They position themselves as an "EDV-Partner."
*   **Services Offered:**
    *   IT-Betreuung (Managed IT Support)
    *   IT-Sicherheit (IT Security)
    *   Netzwerktechnik (Network Technology)
    *   Hardware & Software (Sales and setup)
    *   Cloud Lösungen (Cloud Solutions)
    *   Telefonanlagen (Telephone Systems / VoIP)
*   **Location:** Plüddemanngasse 93, 8010 Graz, Austria. This is a physical office, not just a mailing address.
*   **History:** The business was founded in 1997. This is a significant point of experience and stability.
*   **Team:** The business is led by Ing. Martin Wimmer. There appears to be a small team, but no individual profiles or details are available on the current site.

### 2. Content Worth Keeping

This is what we can leverage from their existing presence.

*   **Established History:** The "since 1997" fact is a powerful trust signal and must be featured prominently. It differentiates them from newer competitors.
*   **Core Service List:** The current list of six services is a clear and solid foundation for the new site's main navigation and service pages.
*   **Google Business Profile Reviews:** Their GBP has positive reviews. These are authentic, third-party testimonials that must be integrated or highlighted on the new website.
*   **Physical Address:** The Graz address grounds the business locally and should be easy to find on the new site (footer, contact page).

*Data is thin in this area. The current site lacks on-page testimonials, case studies, certifications, or partner logos (e.g., Microsoft Partner, ESET Partner). We must actively seek this content from the client during the discovery phase.*

### 3. SEO Intelligence

*   **Ranking Keywords:** The site primarily ranks for branded searches like "Wimmer EDV" and a few specific, low-competition local terms like "EDV Betreuung Graz."
*   **Traffic Pages:** The vast majority of organic traffic lands on the homepage. The individual service pages likely receive minimal direct traffic from search engines.
*   **Google Business Profile (GBP):** They have a claimed and active GBP. This is their most important local SEO asset. It appears in map searches and for direct brand searches, displaying their location, hours, and reviews. The new website must be tightly integrated with it.

### 4. Competitive Landscape

Searches for key services ("IT Support Graz," "Netzwerktechnik Graz") reveal several local competitors.

*   **Key Competitors:** `bitperfect.at`, `netcomplete.at`, `it-graz.at`
*   **How Competitors Present Themselves:**
    *   **Modern Design:** Competitors use clean, professional, and mobile-responsive designs. Wimmer EDV's current site looks severely dated in comparison.
    *   **Clear Calls-to-Action (CTAs):** Competitor sites guide users with buttons like "Get a Free Consultation," "Contact Us Now," or "Learn More."
    *   **Social Proof:** They prominently display client logos, testimonials, and case studies on their homepages to build immediate trust.
    *   **Human Element:** Many feature professional photos of their team members, which makes them seem more approachable.

### 5. Voice & Language

*   **Language:** The website is exclusively in German. There is no English version.
*   **Tone:** The tone is formal and professional ("Ihr EDV-Partner"). It is direct and service-oriented.
*   **Technical Level:** The language is accessible to a business owner, not just an IT expert. It explains the *what* and *why* of their services without getting lost in overly technical jargon. This is a good foundation to build upon.

### 6. Missing Pieces

This is the gap we need to fill to make the new site competitive.

*   **Trust Signals:** The site desperately needs testimonials, client logos, case studies, and any certifications or official partnerships.
*   **Team Page:** A page with photos and brief bios of the team would humanize the business and build trust. "Who will be handling my IT?" is a key customer question.
*   **Modern, Responsive Design:** The current site is not mobile-friendly and its outdated aesthetic undermines their credibility as a technology company.
*   **Detailed Service Pages:** Current service descriptions are thin. Each service needs a dedicated page explaining the benefits, process, and target audience (e.g., "IT Security for law firms").
*   **Lead Generation Funnels:** There are no clear paths for a potential customer. The only action is to find the contact page. We need clear CTAs on every page.
*   **Content Marketing / Blog:** There is no blog or news section to demonstrate expertise, share updates, or improve SEO for relevant topics.

### 7. Red Flags

*   **Outdated Design:** This is the most significant red flag. A technology company's website should reflect technological competence. The current site does the opposite and creates a poor first impression.
*   **Thin Content:** The shallow descriptions of services hurt both user understanding and search engine ranking potential.
*   **Static Nature:** The site appears to have not been updated in many years. This can signal to potential clients that the business is not active or keeping up with modern trends.
*   **Lack of Security Signals:** No visible SSL certificate in the address bar (the link provided is `https`, which is good, but the browser may show warnings if it's improperly configured). The site's visual age doesn't inspire confidence in their security expertise.
