### **Wimmer EDV: Website Redesign Strategy Document**

**Preamble: Data Reconciliation**

The initial research provided contained conflicting information regarding several different companies named "Wimmer EDV" or similar across Austria (St. Pölten, Waldbach-Mönichwald, Regau, Schleissheim). This synthesis has **discarded the irrelevant data** and focuses exclusively on the correct target entity for this project: **Wimmer EDV GmbH, located at Dr.-Adolf-Schärf-Straße 10, A-3107 St. Pölten, owned and operated by Thomas Wimmer.** All recommendations are based on the identity, reputation, and online presence of this specific company.

### ## The Business (facts only)

*   **Who They Are:** Wimmer EDV GmbH, a limited liability company owned and managed entirely by its founder, Thomas Wimmer.
*   **What They Do:** A full-service IT provider for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs / KMU). Their core services are structured into four pillars:
    1.  **IT Security** (Firewall, Antivirus, Backup)
    2.  **Cloud Solutions** (Microsoft 365, Hosted Exchange, Cloud Backup)
    3.  **IT Service & Support** (Consulting, Maintenance, Remote & On-site Support)
    4.  **Hardware & Software** (Sales and support for PCs, Servers, Networks, etc.)
*   **How Long:** The legal entity (GmbH) was founded in 2019. However, the founder, Thomas Wimmer, has over 10 years of professional experience in the field, which forms the true foundation of the company's expertise.
*   **Where:** Based in St. Pölten, Austria. They primarily serve businesses in the St. Pölten region and surrounding Lower Austria.
*   **Target Audience:** Small and medium-sized businesses (KMU) in their local region who need a reliable, all-in-one IT partner.

### ## The Story

The narrative of Wimmer EDV is that of **The Expert Practitioner.**

This isn't a large, anonymous corporation or a decades-old family dynasty. It's the story of a seasoned IT professional, Thomas Wimmer, who leveraged over a decade of hands-on experience to build his own company. He is the founder, the owner, and the expert. The business was established on a foundation of his personal reputation for competence and reliability.

Clients don't hire a faceless company; they hire Thomas Wimmer and his team's direct expertise. The story is one of **personal accountability, deep technical knowledge, and a commitment to being a trusted, accessible local partner.** The business is young as a legal entity, but its wisdom is mature.

### ## What They're Known For

Wimmer EDV has built a stellar, albeit localized, reputation based on two pillars: **verifiable customer satisfaction** and **elite industry credibility**.

*   **Flawless Public Reputation:** They hold a perfect **5.0-star rating** across Google (11 reviews) and Facebook (6 opinions). The feedback is unanimous and consistent, with key themes being:
    *   **Competence & Professionalism** (*"kompetent," "hohe Fachkompetenz"*)
    *   **Speed & Reliability** (*"rasche Hilfe," "schnelle Reaktionszeit," "zuverlässig"*)
    *   **Personal & Friendly Service** (*"persönliche Betreuung," "sehr freundlich"*)
    *   **Solution-Oriented Approach** (*"lösungsorientiert," "unkompliziert"*)

*   **Elite Industry Certifications:** Their credibility is cemented by top-tier partnerships with global technology leaders. These are not just logos; they are proof of rigorous training and audited expertise.
    *   **Microsoft Gold Partner** (A very high level of Microsoft certification)
    *   **Veeam ProPartner Gold** (Expertise in modern backup & recovery)
    *   **Sophos Silver Partner** (Proven capability in cybersecurity)

They are known as the go-to experts who are not only technically proficient at the highest levels but also reliable and easy to work with.

### ## The Competitive Reality

While the provided competitor research was for the wrong region, we can make a strong, educated assumption: the standard for IT service providers in a regional capital like St. Pölten is **high**. Competitors will have modern, professional, responsive websites. A dated online presence is a significant liability.

Wimmer EDV's current website is clean and functional, but it doesn't give them a competitive edge. Their opportunity lies not in just having a "modern website," but in using it to **aggressively communicate their unique differentiators.**

**The Opportunity:** Competitors may offer similar services, but few can likely claim the powerful combination that Wimmer EDV possesses:
1.  The **personal accountability** of an owner-led firm.
2.  The **unanimous 5-star praise** from local clients.
3.  The **elite "Gold-Level" certifications** from industry giants like Microsoft and Veeam.

The new website must weaponize this combination to stand out.

### ## Content Goldmine

The company already has a wealth of authentic, high-impact content ready to be leveraged for the redesign:

*   **Named Client Testimonials:** The "Referenzen" page features strong, benefit-driven quotes from long-term clients (e.g., Scheuringer & Partner, Eder Ziviltechniker). These are perfect for scattering throughout the site.
*   **Google & Facebook Review Snippets:** The public reviews offer dozens of powerful, punchy quotes that can be used as social proof on the homepage, service pages, and contact page.
*   **High-Value Trust Seals:** The logos for **Microsoft Gold Partner, Veeam Gold Partner, and Sophos Silver Partner** are critical assets. They immediately convey a level of expertise that sets them apart from smaller competitors.
*   **The Founder's Story:** Thomas Wimmer's "10+ years of experience" is a core piece of content that builds trust and explains the company's deep expertise despite the 2019 founding date of the GmbH.

### ## The Gaps

Identifying what's missing is key to making the redesign successful.

*   **The Human Element is Missing:** The current website is anonymous. There are no photos or bios of Thomas Wimmer or his team. For a business built on personal expertise and trust, this is a major missed opportunity.
*   **Low Volume of Public Proof:** While the quality of reviews is perfect, the quantity (11 on Google) is low for a business with a decade of client relationships. There is no system in place to encourage happy clients to become public advocates.
*   **From Features to Benefits:** Service descriptions are functional but lack benefit-oriented language. They explain *what* Wimmer EDV does, but not *why* it matters to the client (e.g., "We sell firewalls" vs. "We protect your business from data breaches that could cost you thousands").
*   **No Case Studies:** Testimonials are great, but a simple 1-2 paragraph case study (Problem -> Solution -> Result) would be immensely powerful in demonstrating their problem-solving capabilities.

### ## Redesign Recommendations

The new website must be more than a digital brochure; it must be a trust-building engine.

**The #1 Goal:** To establish Wimmer EDV as the **premier, most trusted IT partner for SMEs in St. Pölten** by showcasing their unique combination of personal expertise, flawless reputation, and elite-level certifications.

**Key Design & Content Strategies:**

1.  **Lead with Trust, Not Technology:** The hero section of the homepage should immediately communicate their core value proposition. Instead of "IT Services," it should say something like: **"Your Gold-Certified IT Partner in St. Pölten. Reliable, fast, and personally managed."**
2.  **Humanize the Brand:** Create a compelling "About Us" page featuring a professional photo and bio of Thomas Wimmer. His story and philosophy should be central to the brand. This connects the company's high-level certifications to a real, accountable person.
3.  **Integrate Social Proof Everywhere:**
    *   Place the **Microsoft Gold, Veeam Gold, and Sophos logos** prominently in the site header or footer, and on the homepage.
    *   Sprinkle short, impactful testimonial quotes and 5-star ratings **on every key page** (Home, Services, Contact), not just a single "Testimonials" page.
4.  **Rewrite Services for the Client:** Reframe all service descriptions to focus on solving business problems and delivering tangible benefits (e.g., "peace of mind," "increased productivity," "reduced risk," "cost savings").
5.  **Implement a Clear Call to Action (CTA):** Every page should guide the visitor toward a single, clear next step. "Request a Free Consultation" or "Get Your IT Health Check" is much more compelling than a simple "Contact Us."

**Essential Features:**
*   Fully responsive (mobile-first) design.
*   Prominent display of contact information (phone number visible at all times).
*   A simple, clear contact form.
*   A dedicated section showcasing partner logos and certifications.
*   An integrated system or page to display a feed of positive Google reviews.
*   A "News" or "Blog" section to share IT tips and demonstrate ongoing expertise.
