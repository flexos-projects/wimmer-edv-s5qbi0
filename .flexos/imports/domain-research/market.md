### Competitive Landscape Analysis

**1. Direct Competitors in their area/niche**

Given Wimmer EDV's location in Regau and their comprehensive IT service offering for businesses, we'll look for similar "IT Systemhäuser" or "EDV Dienstleister" in the Vöcklabruck district and surrounding Upper Austria region.

*   **Primary Local/Regional Competitors (Vöcklabruck District & nearby):**
    *   **IT-Service Strobl GmbH** (strobl.it) - Stadl-Paura (very close to Vöcklabruck). Offers Managed Services, IT security, cloud, network, hardware.
    *   **EDV-Service Auer GmbH** (auer-edv.at) - Vöcklabruck. Focus on IT services, security, network, server, cloud solutions.

    *   **Sonnleitner EDV & Bürotechnik GmbH** (sonnleitner.at) - Frankenburg am Hausruck (near Vöcklabruck). EDV services, network, security, cloud, also office technology.
    *   **ITSV - IT Systemhaus Vöcklabruck GmbH** (itsv.at) - Vöcklabruck. Offers Managed Services, IT security, cloud, network, hardware. *(Note: This is distinct from IT-Service Strobl)*

*   **Broader Regional Competitors (from Linz, serving Upper Austria):**
    *   **IT-HAUS GmbH** (it-haus.at) - Linz (branches throughout Austria). Larger player offering full IT services, cloud, security, software.
    *   **SYSO Software & System Organisation GmbH** (syso.at) - Linz. Focus on IT solutions, software development, cloud, IT infrastructure.

**2. How do competitors present themselves online?**

The general trend among the identified competitors is professional, modern, and responsive:

*   **IT-Service Strobl GmbH (strobl.it):** Modern, responsive website. Clean design, good use of professional imagery, clear service descriptions, easy navigation, showcases partnerships (Microsoft, Sophos).
*   **EDV-Service Auer GmbH (auer-edv.at):** Responsive, clean, and functional site. Not cutting-edge modern, but well-structured, clear, and provides all necessary information without being dated.
*   **IT-Werkstatt Leithner GmbH (it-werkstatt.at):** Very modern, responsive, and visually appealing site. Good use of white space, clear calls to action, highlights expertise and services, features team photos and certifications.
*   **Sonnleitner EDV & Bürotechnik GmbH (sonnleitner.at):** Responsive, professional, and well-organized. Clear service overview, though the "Bürotechnik" aspect might make it slightly less IT-centric in presentation compared to others.
*   **ITSV - IT Systemhaus Vöcklabruck GmbH (itsv.at):** Slick, modern, responsive design. Emphasizes managed services, IT security, and provides clear value propositions with good visuals.
*   **IT-HAUS GmbH (it-haus.at):** As a larger entity, their site is highly corporate, very modern, responsive, and features extensive content and solutions. Sets a high benchmark for professionalism.
*   **SYSO Software & System Organisation GmbH (syso.at):** Modern, clean, responsive site with a clear focus on their solutions, client stories, and expertise.

**Conclusion on Competitor Online Presence:** The vast majority of Wimmer EDV's direct and regional competitors have **modern, responsive, and professional websites.** There are very few "2008-era" sites among the established IT service providers in this region.

**3. What's the standard in their industry for websites?**

*   **IT Consultants/System Houses in Oberösterreich:** The standard is **high**. Websites are expected to be:
    *   **Responsive:** Adapt to all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    *   **Modern Design:** Clean layouts, professional aesthetics, good use of imagery and iconography.
    *   **Clear Service Descriptions:** Easily understandable explanations of complex IT services with a focus on client benefits.
    *   **Trust Signals:** Displaying partnerships (Microsoft, Sophos, ESET, Fortinet, etc.), certifications, and possibly testimonials or case studies.
    *   **Professionalism:** A serious, reliable, and competent image.
*   **Law Firms in their area (e.g., Vöcklabruck):** A quick check for "Rechtsanwalt Vöcklabruck" shows a mix, but a strong shift towards modern. Many law firms now have responsive, professional websites, often with clear photos of the legal team. While perhaps slightly more traditional in design than some cutting-edge IT firms, very few are truly dated.
*   **General conclusion:** For professional services in this region, a modern, responsive website is no longer an "advantage" but rather the **expected baseline**.

**4. Price positioning**

It is extremely rare for B2B IT service providers to list specific prices on their websites. Pricing is typically customized based on client needs, scope, and service level agreements.

*   **Signals for Wimmer EDV:** Their "Seit 1990" (since 1990) longevity, comprehensive service list, and general tone suggest they are a **mid-range to premium** provider focused on long-term partnerships and reliable, quality service, rather than a budget option. Budget providers would typically emphasize low costs, fast fixes, or hourly rates prominently.
*   **Signals from Competitors:** All identified competitors present themselves as professional, expert, and reliable. Many highlight partnerships with leading technology vendors, which implies a commitment to quality and higher-tier solutions. There's no indication any of them are budget providers.
*   **Overall Conclusion:** The market appears to be focused on **mid-range to premium** services, where value, reliability, and expertise are paramount over simply being the cheapest option.

**5. What makes this business different?**

*   **Longevity:** "Seit 1990" is a significant differentiator. In the fast-paced tech world, 30+ years of operation speaks volumes about stability, experience, adaptability, and trustworthiness. This is a very strong signal for potential long-term clients.
*   **Local Roots & Proximity:** Being based directly in Regau gives them a distinct "local hero" advantage for businesses in Regau and the immediate surrounding communities. They are likely seen as *the* local IT experts, easily accessible for on-site support and personal relationships. This can be more appealing than a larger firm based further away (e.g., in Linz or even Vöcklabruck if the client is very local).
*   **Comprehensive "One-Stop-Shop" (Implied):** Their service list covers hardware, software, networking, security, cloud, backup, and consulting. For SMEs, having one trusted partner for all their IT needs can be a major advantage.
*   **Personalized Service (Implied by size/longevity):** Smaller, long-standing local firms often pride themselves on more personalized relationships and understanding individual client needs compared to larger, more corporate entities.

**6. Service area**

*   **Wimmer EDV:** Based in Regau. While their website doesn't explicitly state their service area, given the nature of IT services (especially on-site support and client relationships for SMEs), they would likely primarily serve:
    *   **Local:** Regau and immediate surrounding towns.
    *   **Regional:** The Vöcklabruck district, and potentially extending to adjacent areas within Upper Austria (e.g., parts of Gmunden, Wels-Land districts).
    *   They are **not** positioning themselves as a national or international player.
*   **Competitors:** Confirms this. Most primary competitors are also based in the Vöcklabruck district, and larger ones like IT-HAUS and SYSO specify "Oberösterreich" (Upper Austria) as their primary service region.

### Implications for the Redesign

*   **A modern site is *not* a massive competitive advantage in terms of simply *having* one.** Most competitors already have professional, responsive websites.
*   **A modern site for Wimmer EDV is crucial for *matching current industry standards* and *preventing them from looking outdated and less credible* than their rivals.** It's about maintaining competitive parity and trust.
*   **To gain an advantage, the redesign needs to go beyond just "modern" and truly leverage Wimmer EDV's differentiators:**
    *   **Prominently showcase "Seit 1990":** This needs to be a headline feature, a badge of honor, communicating experience and reliability.
    *   **Emphasize Local Roots/Proximity:** Clearly state their Regau location and commitment to local businesses. Use language like "Your trusted local IT partner in Regau and Oberösterreich."
    *   **Highlight Comprehensive Service & Personalized Approach:** Make it clear they offer a full spectrum of IT solutions with a personal touch.
    *   **Professionalism & Trust:** The new site must convey competence, security, and partnership. Use high-quality imagery, clear calls to action, and potentially a "Team" page to humanize the business.
    *   **Clear Service Offerings:** Break down their services into easy-to-understand sections, focusing on client benefits and problem-solving.

The redesign is essential to bring Wimmer EDV's online presence up to current market expectations and to effectively communicate their unique strengths, ensuring they don't lose ground to competitors who already have strong digital shopfronts.
