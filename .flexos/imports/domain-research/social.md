**Summary of Online Presence:**

Wimmer EDV has a foundational online presence with:
*   A well-maintained **Google Business Profile** (5-star rating, recent reviews, current hours).
*   An official listing with the **WKO (Austrian Federal Economic Chamber)** and **Herold.at**.
*   A **LinkedIn profile** for its managing director.

**Missing / Dormant Presences:**
*   No dedicated **Facebook page**.
*   No **Instagram** or **YouTube** presence.
*   No presence on **Yelp** or **Gelbeseiten.at**.

**Key Discrepancy:**
The WKO listing indicates "GmbH in Liquidation" (limited liability company in liquidation), which is a critical piece of information that contrasts with the seemingly active website and Google Business Profile offering services. This suggests a potential change in the company's operational status or legal structure that isn't reflected consistently across all online presences. This should be verified for any business interactions.
