### Conclusion & Content Opportunity

Wimmer EDV has a **stellar reputation** among the customers who have chosen to leave public reviews or testimonials. The feedback is consistently positive, highlighting core strengths in technical expertise, responsiveness, reliability, and customer service. Their extensive list of major vendor partnerships further solidifies their credibility and capabilities.

The primary "gap" is the **relatively low volume of public reviews** (11 on Google, 6 on Facebook) for a company founded in 1999 (over 20 years in business). This presents a significant **content opportunity**:

*   **Proactively solicit more Google and Facebook reviews** from their satisfied client base. Given the consistent positive feedback, increasing the review count would significantly boost their online visibility and credibility to potential new clients who rely heavily on social proof.
*   The existing testimonials on their site are excellent, but integrating a call to action for public reviews could convert more of their happy clients into public advocates.
