### Description

The Homepage Hero Section is the first element a visitor sees and is the most critical component for making a positive first impression. It must quickly and clearly communicate the company's core value proposition: providing local, certified, and trusted IT services. This section will feature a compelling headline, a supportive sub-headline, a primary Call-to-Action (CTA) to guide the user journey, and essential trust seals (partner logos, star rating) to establish immediate credibility.

### User Stories

*   **As a first-time visitor,** I want to immediately understand what the company does and why I should trust them, so I can quickly decide if they are a good fit for my business needs.
*   **As a business owner looking for IT support,** I want to see a clear and obvious next step, such as a "Get a Free Consultation" button, so I can easily take action to solve my problem.
*   **As a user evaluating credibility,** I want to see proof of qualifications like official partner logos and positive ratings right away, so I feel confident in the company's expertise.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A single, clear H1 headline is present.
- [ ] A sub-headline communicating the core value proposition (local, certified, trusted) is present below the main headline.
- [ ] A prominent primary Call-to-Action (CTA) button is visible and clickable.
- [ ] The CTA button leads to the Contact Page or a dedicated consultation form.
- [ ] High-resolution Microsoft and Veeam Gold partner logos are clearly displayed.
- [ ] A visual representation of a 5-star rating (e.g., five gold stars) is visible.
- [ ] The entire section is fully responsive, with a layout that adapts cleanly to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
- [ ] All text is legible against the background image or color.

### Technical Notes

*   **CMS Integration:** The headline, sub-headline, and CTA button text/link should be easily editable in the Content Management System (CMS).
*   **Asset Optimization:** Partner logos should be in SVG format for crisp rendering at any size. The background image (if used) must be optimized for fast loading times.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text and interactive elements. The CTA button must be keyboard-navigable and have a clear focus state.
