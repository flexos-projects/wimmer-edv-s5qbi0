### Creative & Visual Design Brief

This brief provides clear direction for the visual design of the Wimmer EDV website, translating the brand personality of "calm competence" into a tangible aesthetic.

#### **Overall Aesthetic: The Modern Professional**

The design will be clean, structured, and confident. It will feel like a premium tech consultancy, not a small local repair shop. We will achieve this through generous use of white space, a strong grid system, and a meticulous attention to typographic detail. The aesthetic is reassuring, organized, and utterly professional.

**Inspiration Sites:**
*   **Stripe:** For its clean typography, structured layout, and use of subtle gradients and accents.
*   **Intercom:** For its human-centric photography and clear, benefit-focused messaging.
*   **A-Team Systems:** A direct competitor example that does a good job with a clean, professional, blue-themed aesthetic that we can elevate.

#### **Color Palette: Trust and Tech**

The palette moves away from generic "tech blue" to a more sophisticated and grounded combination.

*   **Primary - Slate Blue:** `#2d3748`
    *   **Rationale:** This deep, slightly desaturated blue serves as our foundation. It's stable, serious, and professional. It conveys trust without feeling cold or corporate. To be used for headlines, dark backgrounds, and key UI elements.
*   **Accent - Tech Green:** `#38A169`
    *   **Rationale:** A vibrant but professional green. This color signifies "go," "health," and "success." It will be used sparingly but effectively for calls-to-action (buttons), links, and key icons to draw the user's eye and prompt action.
*   **Secondary - Warm Ochre:** `#D69E2E` (Optional, for highlights)
    *   **Rationale:** A warm, golden-ochre to complement the blue and green. Could be used for highlighting "Gold Partner" status or for subtle graphic elements.
*   **Neutrals:**
    *   **Off-White:** `#F7FAFC` (For page backgrounds, feels softer than pure white).
    *   **Light Gray:** `#E2E8F0` (For borders, cards, and subtle dividers).
    *   **Dark Text:** `#1A202C` (A very dark gray, easier on the eyes than pure black).

#### **Typography: Clarity and Confidence**

Our typography will be modern, legible, and confident, using a single versatile font family for harmony.

*   **Font Family:** **Inter** (Available on Google Fonts)
    *   **Rationale:** Inter is a highly legible, geometric sans-serif designed specifically for screen use. It has a wide range of weights, making it perfect for creating a clear visual hierarchy. It feels modern, neutral, and professional.
*   **Headlines (H1, H2, H3):** Inter (Bold, `700` weight). Large, well-spaced headings will command attention and establish a clear structure.
*   **Body Copy:** Inter (Regular, `400` weight). Set at a comfortable size (16-18px) with generous line height (1.6) for maximum readability.

#### **Photography & Visual Style**

We are eliminating generic stock photos. The new visual direction is **authentic and human-centric.**

*   **Photography Style:**
    *   **People:** Professional, authentic photos of Thomas Wimmer and his team are essential. These should be warm and approachable. For supporting imagery, we will use high-quality photos that show their target clients: engaged small business owners and office staff in modern, clean work environments. The focus is on the *outcome* of good IT: productivity, collaboration, and peace of mind.
    *   **Tone:** Bright, natural lighting. A shallow depth of field can be used to create a professional feel. No cheesy handshakes or server room clichés.
*   **Iconography:**
    *   Clean, minimalist line-art icons. The style should be consistent across the site. They will be used to visually represent services and key benefits, aiding scannability and adding a touch of modern sophistication.

#### **Key Visual Moments**

*   **Hero Section:** A powerful, high-quality photograph of Thomas Wimmer or a clean, abstract background with a bold typographic statement. The Microsoft and Veeam Gold logos must be rendered beautifully and prominently.
*   **Service Cards:** On the `/it-leistungen` page, each service will be represented by a clean card with a custom icon, a strong headline, and a short description. Hover effects will provide subtle interactivity.
*   **Testimonial Display:** Testimonials will be designed as visually appealing blockquotes, featuring the author's name, company, and a 5-star rating graphic. They will stand out from the body text.

**Mobile-First Priorities:** The design process will start with the mobile view to ensure the core message, navigation, and CTAs are perfectly optimized for the smallest screens. The click-to-call phone number in the header is a critical mobile feature.
