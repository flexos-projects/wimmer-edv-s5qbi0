*   **Geographic Focus:** St. Pölten and the surrounding Lower Austria region.
*   **Client Profile:** Businesses requiring a comprehensive, outsourced IT partner.

#### **4. Verifiable Trust Assets (Content Goldmine)**

The project begins with an exceptional collection of high-value, verifiable trust signals.

*   **Public Reputation:**
    *   **Google:** Perfect 5.0-star rating (11 reviews).
    *   **Facebook:** Perfect 5.0-star rating (6 opinions).
    *   **Key Themes in Reviews:** Competence, speed, reliability, friendliness, solution-oriented.
*   **Elite Industry Certifications:**
    *   **Microsoft Gold Partner:** A top-tier, difficult-to-achieve certification.
    *   **Veeam ProPartner Gold:** Demonstrates elite expertise in modern backup and data recovery.
    *   **Sophos Silver Partner:** Proven expertise in cybersecurity.
*   **Named Client Testimonials:** Existing "Referenzen" page features quotes from established clients like Scheuringer & Partner and Eder Ziviltechniker.

#### **5. Identified Gaps & Missing Data**

The following critical content and assets are currently missing and must be addressed in the redesign project.

*   **Human Element:** No photos or biographical information for Thomas Wimmer or any team members. This is the single largest gap, as the business is built on his personal expertise.
*   **Visual Assets:** Lack of high-quality, authentic photography of the office, team, or client environments. The project will require a professional photoshoot.
*   **Case Studies:** No structured problem/solution/result narratives that demonstrate the value of their work in a compelling story format.
*   **Benefit-Oriented Copy:** Current service descriptions are feature-based ("We sell firewalls") rather than benefit-based ("We protect your business from costly data breaches").
*   **Systematic Review Generation:** While review quality is perfect, the quantity is low. There is no active process for encouraging satisfied clients to leave public reviews.

This summary confirms that Wimmer EDV's core strengths are its verifiable expertise (certifications) and flawless local reputation (reviews), centered on the personal accountability of its founder, Thomas Wimmer. The redesign's primary function is to bring these powerful assets to the forefront.
